# Slow Twitter

This is a chrome extension that forces you to read your twitter feed more slowly.

## Install

Download this repository to your local machine. You should now have a folder called something like `slow-twtter` on your computer. (It should have 4 files in it.)

Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser and turn on developer mode in the top right.

On the top left, click 'Load Unpacked' and select the `slow-twitter` folder.

It should turn up as an extension! Go to twitter.com to see the difference.
